# Mane Memo

### 🪷 Your digital hair journal for healthier, stronger hair.

Mane Memo helps you track your hair care journey all in one place. You can log your daily hair care experiments - such as protein treatments, DIY deep conditioning masks, clarifying washes, and hairstyles. Analyze what works and what doesn't, and track your progress over time.

The inspiration behind this project comes from my own personal experience. After years of using chemical treatments like relaxers to manage and straighten my hair, I began to embrace my natural hair. That change came with a lot of trial and error to figure out what worked for my hair and what didn't.

I often found myself saving Word docs full of routines, tips, and advice from natural haircare forums. I wanted to create a digital version of that experience.
